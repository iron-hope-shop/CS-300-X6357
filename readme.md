### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving the the projects for this course was algorithm optimization.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by identifying the business need, comparing it with the algorithms we have learned thus far, and choosing the appropriate data structures based on my knowledge from the course.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by referencing the text and various other sources provided by my professor.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by introducing me to the methodologies employed to determine algorithm optimization patterns.  Previously I was unaware of the `Big O Notation` and I have since applied this to my everyday work.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this, and other projects during my time at SNHU, have evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by providing working standards for comments and code structure.  By clearly and concisely adding comments and headers to files I have found my co-workers are amazed at the ease of implementation of new APIs and libraries I have worked on.
